# The website of Anne Cecilie Ukkelberg

In the spirit of openness, I'm always glad to share my code.

This is a website and design - based off Twitter Bootstrap - made for a model friend of mine. It will - when it's done -
be complete with galleries, resume templates and all a budding model needs.

This is still a work in progress, but a great way to hone my frontend skills - and a cool thing to do for a friend :-)

The latest tag is always available online at [annececilieukkelberg.com](http://www.annececilieukkelberg.com).

## Planned future features
- Making the site more friendly for mobile and tablet browsers
- Implementing a CMS (Wordpress or perhaps something a bit more exotic)
- Making the site accessible up to the WCAG 2.0 standard
