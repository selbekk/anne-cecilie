# The website of Anne Cecilie Ukkelberg

In the spirit of openness, I'm always glad to share my code.

This is a website and design - based off Twitter Bootstrap - made for a model friend of mine. It is
complete with galleries, resume templates and all a budding model needs.

This website is still under active development, and probably will be for the foreseeable future.

## Release 1.1

The first release is now available (check out tag v1.1).

The repo now contains two folders - one containing the first version of the design,
and another one containing the wordpress theme.

### Features
- Support for blogging
- Support for galleries
- Support for mailing
- Support for templates for seveal types of posts and pages
- Mobile friendly and responsive design

## Support

I don't really offer support on this project, but if you find a bug, please report it as an issue.

## Future features
- A real gallery (instead of linking to the standard content page)
- Making the site accessible up to the WCAG 2.0 standard
